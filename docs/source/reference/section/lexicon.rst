.. rubric:: Section lexicon

The `Section` module defines some terms that are used throughout the code and rest of the documentation. 

Most importantly, a Section is defined by a set of coordinates in the x-y plane of a cube.

Therefore, we transform variable definitions when extracting the section, and the coordinate system of the section is defined by the down-strike direction :math:`s` and the vertical section coordinate :math:`z`.
