*********************************
Sample data
*********************************

The package includes several sample data sets to show how to interact with the
API. You do not need to get your data into the same format as these data, but
it may help coerce the data into the appropriate classes of the API. 

The sample data are defined in ``deltametrics.sample_data``.
