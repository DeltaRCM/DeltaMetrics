How to set up any dataset to work with DeltaMetrics
---------------------------------------------------

This guide describes how to set up any spatiotemporal (`t-x-y`) dataset to work with DeltaMetrics. 

First, let's make some sample data:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: reset

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from netCDF4 import Dataset
    import os

    import deltametrics as dm

    ## create the model data
    # some spatial information
    x = np.arange(0, 6, 0.1)
    y = np.arange(0, 3, 0.1)

    # some temporal information
    t = np.arange(1, 5)

    # meshes for each to make fake data
    T, Y, X = np.meshgrid(t, y, x, indexing='ij')

    # make fake time by x by y data
    #   hint: this would be the data from a model, experiment, or the field
    eta = np.sin(T * X + Y)
    velocity = np.cos(T * Y + X)
    H_SL = np.linspace(0.25, 0.9, num=len(t)) # sea level

And we can see what this data looks like for a comparison with the data when we eventually have it in a `DataCube`.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:

    # check out the data before we save it into a netcdf file
    print("eta shape:", eta.shape)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, len(t), figsize=(8, 3))
    for i, _t in enumerate(t):
        ax[0, i].imshow(eta[i, :, :])
        ax[1, i].imshow(velocity[i, :, :])
    plt.show()

.. note:: 

    You can name the spatial dimensions anything. Here, we have set the data up so that `y` is the first spatial dimension; this is opposite from `pyDeltaRCM` output data, where `x` is the downstream first spatial dimension. 


Connecting with NetCDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard I/O format for data used in DeltaMetrics is a NetCDF4 file, structured as sets of arrays. 
NetCDF was designed with dimensional data in mind, so that we can use common dimensions to align and manipulate multiple different underlying variables.

.. important::

    Taking the time to set your data up correctly in a netCDF file is the preferred way to use DeltaMetrics with your own data.

This guide is not meant to be an exhaustive guide on the netCDF format, so we provide only a simple overview of some core components that affect DeltaMetrics.

* `dataset`: the file, including all of the data and metadata to describe that data
* `variable`: a field in the `dataset` that contains numeric information
* `dimension`: a field in the `dataset` describing one dimension of the underlying data variables
* `group`: a mechanism for constructing a hierarchy of information within the `dataset`.

DeltaMetrics NetCDF data standards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For DeltaMetrics to correctly work with underlying data, you must properly configure the dimensions and variables of the dataset.

* DeltaMetrics expects your core underlying spatiotemporal data (like 2D fields of elevation data, velocity, etc) to be organized into 3D arrays, with time along the first axis and two spatial dimensions along the next two axes.
* DeltaMetrics expects *at least* three `dimensions` defined in the `dataset`, one of which must be named ``time``, and the other two can have any name that describes the spatial dimensions of the data (e.g., `x`, `lon`, `easting`, etc.).
* DeltaMetrics expects a `variable` with name *exactly matching* the name of each of the three previous `dimensions`.
* DeltaMetrics expects some number of `variables` with arbitrary names that each contain a 3D array of spatiotemporal data of interest. I.e., this is the actual model/field/experiment data.
* DeltaMetrics expects there to be a `group` with name `meta`, which contains any information relevant to the spatiotemporal data. E.g., sea level, coordinates of sediment feed location.


Sample code for creating a DeltaMetrics NetCDF file with Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we write out the data to a netCDF file.

.. hint::

    You can use `None` as the length of the time dimension, if you want to create the NetCDF file while your model runs, and you do not know the size a priori.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    import tempfile

    output_folder = tempfile.gettempdir()
    file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, 'model_output.nc')

.. code::

    output_folder = './output'
    file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, 'model_output.nc')

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    ## create and fill the netcdf file 
    output_netcdf = Dataset(file_path, 'w',
                            format='NETCDF4')

    # add some description information (see netCDF docs for more)
    output_netcdf.description = 'Output from MyFakeModel'
    output_netcdf.source = 'MyFakeModel v0.1'

    # create time and spatial netCDF dimensions
    output_netcdf.createDimension('time', T.shape[0])  
    output_netcdf.createDimension('y', T.shape[1])
    output_netcdf.createDimension('x', T.shape[2])

    # create time and spatial netCDF variables
    v_time = output_netcdf.createVariable(
        'time', 'f4', ('time',))
    v_time.units = 'second'
    v_x = output_netcdf.createVariable(
        'x', 'f4', ('x'))
    v_x.units = 'meter'
    v_y = output_netcdf.createVariable(
        'y', 'f4', ('y'))
    v_y.units = 'meter'

    # fill the variables with the coordinate information
    v_time[:] = t
    v_x[:] = x
    v_y[:] = y

    # set up variables for output data grids
    v_eta = output_netcdf.createVariable(
        'eta', 'f4', ('time', 'y', 'x'))
    v_eta.units = 'meter'
    v_velocity = output_netcdf.createVariable(
        'velocity', 'f4', ('time', 'y', 'x'))
    v_velocity.units = 'meter/second'
    v_eta[:] = eta
    v_velocity[:] = velocity

    # set up metadata group and populate variables
    output_netcdf.createGroup('meta')
    v_L0 = output_netcdf.createVariable(  # a scalar, the inlet length
        'meta/L0', 'f4', ())  # no dims for scalar
    v_L0.units = 'cell'
    v_L0[:] = 5
    v_H_SL = output_netcdf.createVariable( # an array, the sea level
        'meta/H_SL', 'f4', ('time',))  # only has time dimensions
    v_H_SL.units = 'meters'
    v_H_SL[:] = H_SL

    # close the netcdf file
    output_netcdf.close()


Now, let's load the NetCDF file with DeltaMetrics. Make a cube by pointing to the directory and file location.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    nc_datacube = dm.cube.DataCube(os.path.join(output_folder, 'model_output.nc'))

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, len(t), figsize=(8, 3))
    for i, _ in enumerate(t):
        nc_datacube.quick_show(
            'eta', idx=i,
            ticks=True, ax=ax[0, i])
        nc_datacube.quick_show(
            'velocity', idx=i,
            ticks=True, ax=ax[1, i])
    plt.show()

Note that the coordinates of the data (i.e., the `x` range in 0 to 6) have been correctly loaded from the NetCDF file and applied in the `DataCube`.

To show that the components of sea level and elevation have been connected:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    dm.plot.aerial_view(
        nc_datacube['eta'][-1, :, :],
        datum=nc_datacube.meta['H_SL'][-1],
        ticks=True)


Sample code for working with data loaded in memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not at all concerned with the size of your data, and loading all of this information into memory *in addition to whatever computational requirements you have for your analysis*, you can input data directly to the `DataCube` as a dictionary.

.. note:: this example uses the sample data defined above.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    # create the dictionary
    data_dict = {'eta': eta,
                 'velocity': velocity}

    # make a cube from it
    dict_datacube = dm.cube.DataCube(
        data_dict,
        dimensions={'time': t,
                    'y': y,
                    'x': x})

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, len(t), figsize=(8, 3))
    for i, _ in enumerate(t):
        dict_datacube.quick_show(
            'eta', idx=i,
            ticks=True, ax=ax[0, i])
        dict_datacube.quick_show(
            'velocity', idx=i,
            ticks=True, ax=ax[1, i])
    plt.show()


Notice that dimensions (range of `x` from 0 to 6) are properly handled, and variables are styled according to the DeltaMetrics default.

.. warning::

    The `meta` data model is not integrated into the dictionary input method.
    
You cannot use integrated metadata to a `DataCube` created from a dictionary; you will need to manage and integrate this metadata manually as needed. 
We do not anticipate this will affect many users, but if you need the ability to add metadata to the `DataCube` from dictionary input, please open an issue request or submit a pull request.

If you want a basic workaround, you can create a dictionary inside the input dictionary, named `meta`. For example:

.. code::

    dict_datacube = dm.cube.DataCube(
        data_dict,
        dimensions={'time': t,
                    'y': y,
                    'x': x,
                    'meta': {'H_SL': H_SL}})

But be aware that dimensions will not be attached to the metadata (unless you pass in a `DataArray`), and you cannot use the `.meta` accessor, and instead would need to use ``dict_datacube['meta']['H_SL']``.


Conventions for data and information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While not strictly necessary, it may be helpful to adhere to a naming convention that DeltaMetrics uses internally to define some common attributes of sedimentary systems. 


Spatiotemporal variable conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `eta`: name any bed elevation variable `eta`. You can still use DeltaMetrics with a field with any other name to represent bed elevation (e.g., `z`), but the default expected name is `eta`, and using `z` may result in confusion---especially if working with stratigraphy.
* Organize model data so that an inlet of sediment and water (if present) is located along the the `dim1==0` domain edge. This is not strictly necessary, but some DeltaMetrics default values will work best this way.


Metadata variable naming conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If any of the following information is available or relevant for your model, experiment, or field site, we recommend adding this information to the `meta` group in an input NetCDF file.

* `H_SL`: name any basin-wide water level as `H_SL` in the metadata, and define it in the same coordinate system as `eta` (e.g., use meters and the same elevation datum).
* `L0`: the `dim1` inlet length, number of indices from the starting edge of `dim1`. Do not include this field if inlet not located along `dim1==0` edge. 
* `CTR`: the `dim2` inlet center, number of indices from the starting edge of `dim2`. Do not include this field if inlet not located along `dim1==0` edge.

.. hint:: 

    None of these variables need to be defined; you can always manually pass them to DeltaMetrics constructors, but following the convention when creating your data file will save you many keystrokes later.
